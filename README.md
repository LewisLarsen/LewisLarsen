## Hello there! 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LewisLarsen/LewisLarsen/master/banner.png)
Nice of you to stop by! My name is Lewis and I am a hobbyist web developer, I am also a student studying Information Technology at the University of Derby. 

My main stack includes Laravel/MySQL however I have been known to branch out to Ruby on Rails/MongoDB on occasion; admittedly PHP is my preferred language of choice currently. While I don't have many public repositories, you are certainly more than welcome to browse any that I do have open to the public.

I am involved in a Star Trek gaming community, [UFPlanets](https://ufplanets.com), where I help lead the news team and occasionally contribute to the development of the website. If you like games and Star Trek, I highly recommend checking us out!

When I am not working on some small project, I enjoy watching Science Fiction, with Star Trek being my favourite series and sometimes I play video games, with Overwatch being my game of choice. I do also enjoy some horror movies, with the original Poltergeist from 1983 being one of my favourite movies of all time!
