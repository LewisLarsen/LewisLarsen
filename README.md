## Hello there!

Nice of you to stop by! My name is Lewis and I am a hobbyist web developer, I am also a student studying Information Technology at the University of Derby. 

My main stack includes Laravel/MySQL however I have been known to branch out to Ruby on Rails/MongoDB on occasion; admittedly PHP is my preferred language of choice currently. While I don't have many public repositories, you are certainly more than welcome to browse any that I do have open to the public.

I am involved in a Star Trek gaming community, [UFPlanets](https://ufplanets.com), where I help lead the news team and occasionally contribute to the development of the website. If you like games and Star Trek, I highly recommend checking us out!

When I am not working on some small project, I enjoy watching Science Fiction, with Star Trek being my favourite series and sometimes I play video games, with Overwatch being my game of choice. I do also enjoy some horror movies, with the original Poltergeist from 1983 being one of my favourite movies of all time! 

If you would like to get in contact with me, please email [lewis.larsen@ufplanets.com](mailto:lewis.larsen@ufplaneets.com) and I will get back to you fairly shortly, alternatively you can also DM me on Twitter! [@LewisLarsen](https://twitter.com/LewisLarsen_). Have a question you would like to ask me or want to tell a joke? Whatever it is, feel free to get in touch. 

Thanks for reading!
